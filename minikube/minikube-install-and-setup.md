1. need to download minikube stable from : 
    https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

2. need to have docker driver for running minikube : so install that from : 
    https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

3. once that is done, we can start the minikube cluster using 
--
        minikube start --driver docker
--
