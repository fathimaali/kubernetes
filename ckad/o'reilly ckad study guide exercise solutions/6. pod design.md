# pod design exercises

1. create three pods that use the image nginx. the names of the pods should be pod-1 pod-2 pod-3. assign label tier=frontend to pod-1, and tier=backend to pod-2 and pod-3. all pods should have label team=artemis

```
    k run pod-1 --image=nginx --labels=tier=frontend,team=artemis
        pod/pod-1 created

    k run pod-2 --image=nginx --labels=tier=backend,team=artemis
        pod/pod-2 created

    k run pod-3 --image=nginx --labels=tier=backend,team=artemis
        pod/pod-3 created
```

2. assign the annotation with the key deployer to pod-1 and pod-3. use your own value as the value.

```
    k annotate pod pod-1 deployer=custom-deployer-fathima
        pod/pod-1 annotate
    k annotate pod pod-1 deployer=custom-deployer-fathima
        pod/pod-1 annotate
```

3. from the command line, use label selection to find all pods with the team artemis or aircontrol and that are considered backend service.

```
    k get pod -l tier=backend,'team in (artemis,aircontrol)'
        NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        pod-2   1/1     Running   0          5m21s
        pod-3   1/1     Running   0          5m15s
```

4. create a new deployment named server-deployment. th deployment should control two replics using image grand-server: 1.4.6

```
    k create deployment server-deployment --image=grand-server:1.4.6
        deployment.apps/server-deployment created

    k get deploy
        NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
        server-deployment   0/1     1            0           5s
```

5. inspect the deployment and find out the root cause of the failure. 

```
    k get pod
        NAME                                 READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
        pod-1                                1/1     Running            0          8m33s
        pod-2                                1/1     Running            0          8m17s
        pod-3                                1/1     Running            0          8m11s
        server-deployment-77bf94cb69-2ggxq   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          76s

    k logs server-deployment-77bf94cb69-2ggxq 
        Error from server (BadRequest): container "grand-server" in pod "server-deployment-77bf94cb69-2ggxq" is waiting to start: trying and failing to pull image

```

6. fix the issue by assigning the image nginx instead. inspect the rollout history. how many revisions would you expect to see?

```
    k get deployment
        NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
        server-deployment   0/1     1            0           3m4s

    k rollout history deployment server-deployment 
        deployment.apps/server-deployment 
        REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
        1         <none>


    k set image deployment server-deployment grand-server=nginx
        deployment.apps/server-deployment image updated

    k rollout history deployment server-deployment 
        deployment.apps/server-deployment 
        REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
        1         <none>
        2         <none>


    k get pod
        NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        pod-1                               1/1     Running   0          11m
        pod-2                               1/1     Running   0          10m
        pod-3                               1/1     Running   0          10m
        server-deployment-7674b659b-gdpth   1/1     Running   0          7s

```
7. create a new cronjob named google-ping. when executed the job should run a curl command for google.com. pick an appropriate image. the execution should occur every two minutes. 

```
    k create cronjob google-ping --image=busybox --restart=Never --schedule='*/2 * * * *' --dry-run=client -o yaml > google-ping.yaml

    vi google-ping.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: google-ping
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: google-ping
    spec:
      template:
        metadata:
          creationTimestamp: null
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: busybox
            name: google-ping
            command: ['wget','-O-','google.com']
            resources: {}
          restartPolicy: Never
  schedule: '*/2 * * * *'
status: {}
```
```
      k create -f google-ping.yaml 
      k get pod
      k get pod
        NAME                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        google-ping-28205848-gp6tc   0/1     Completed   0          3m13s
        google-ping-28205850-5j6bf   0/1     Completed   0          73s

      k get cronjobs
        NAME          SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
        google-ping   */2 * * * *   False     0        52s             3m32s

```

8. tail the logs of cronjob at runtime. check the command-line options of the relevant command or consult the kubernetes documentation.

```
    k logs google-ping-28205852-r82dt -f --->>> this gives logs of pods
    k get cronjob -w --->>> this tails the cronjob values changes
```

9. reconfigure the cronjob to retain a history of seven executions.

```
     k edit cronjob google-ping 
        cronjob.batch/google-ping edited
```

```yaml
spec:
    successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 7
```
```
    k describe cronjobs.batch google-ping 
        Name:                          google-ping
        Namespace:                     default
        Labels:                        <none>
        Annotations:                   <none>
        Schedule:                      */2 * * * *
        Concurrency Policy:            Allow
        Suspend:                       False
        Successful Job History Limit:  7
        Failed Job History Limit:      1
        ...
```

10. reconfigure the cronjob to disallow a new execution if the current execution is still running. consult the k8s documentation for more information. 

```
    k edit cronjob google-ping
        cronjob.batch/google-ping edited
```

```yaml
    spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
```

```
    k describe cronjob google-ping 
        Name:                          google-ping
        Namespace:                     default
        Labels:                        <none>
        Annotations:                   <none>
        Schedule:                      */2 * * * *
        Concurrency Policy:            Forbid
        Suspend:                       False
```
