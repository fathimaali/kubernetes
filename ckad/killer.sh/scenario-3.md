# Preview Question 3

Management of EarthAG recorded that one of their Services stopped working. Dirk, the administrator, left already for the long weekend. All the information they could give you is that it was located in Namespace earth and that it stopped working after the latest rollout. All Services of EarthAG should be reachable from inside the cluster.

Find the Service, fix any issues and confirm it's working again. Write the reason of the error into file /opt/course/p3/ticket-654.txt so Dirk knows what the issue was.
