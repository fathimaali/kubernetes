# admission controllers

1. Write all Admission Controller Plugins, which are enabled in the kube-apiserver manifest, into /root/admission-plugins .

        controlplane $ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep admission 
            - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,LimitRanger,Priority
        controlplane $ cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep admission > /root/admission-plugins
        controlplane $ cat /root/admission-plugins
            - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,LimitRanger,Priority

2. Enable the Admission Controller Plugin MutatingAdmissionWebhook .

        controlplane $ vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml 
        controlplane $ k get node
        The connection to the server 172.30.1.2:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
        controlplane $ watch crictl ps
        controlplane $ k get nodes
            NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
            controlplane   Ready    control-plane   29d   v1.28.1

3. Delete Namespace space1 .
    Delete Namespace default (throws error)  
    Disable the Admission Controller Plugin NamespaceLifecycle . It's not recommended to do this at all, we just do this for showing the effect.
    It can take a few minutes for the apiserver container to restart after changing the manifest. You can watch using watch crictl ps . 
    Now delete Namespace default .

        controlplane $ k delete ns space1
        namespace "space1" deleted
        controlplane $ delete ns default
        delete: command not found
        controlplane $ k delete ns default
        Error from server (Forbidden): namespaces "default" is forbidden: this namespace may not be deleted
        controlplane $ vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml 
            --disable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle
        controlplane $ watch critical ps
        controlplane $ watch crictl ps  
        controlplane $ k get node
        The connection to the server 172.30.1.2:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
        controlplane $ watch crictl ps
        controlplane $ k delete ns default
        namespace "default" deleted
