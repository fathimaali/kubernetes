# ssh basics 

this is not an exercise per se

just a way to understand how to get into another node in the cluster and execute commands there

eg. in a scenario where the node needs to have static provisioned directory for the persistent volume

ssh node01
    now inside node01
    execute commands
    exit
back to controlplane now
