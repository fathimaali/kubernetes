# cronjobs

a scheduled job

spec.schedule takes a cron like formatting of course

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
    name: report-cron-job
spec:
    schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
    jobTemplate: 
        <job-definition-spec>
            ...
            <pod-definition-spec>
             restartPolicy: Never
```

eg. 


```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
    name: report-cron-job
spec:
    schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
    jobTemplate: 
        spec:
            completions: 3
            parallelism: 3
            template: 
                spec:
                    containers:
                    - image: report
                      name: fathimaali/webapp
                    restartPolicy: Never
```

```
    kubectl create -f cron-job-defintion.yaml
    kubectl get cronjob
    kubectl get pods
```

```
k create cronjob throw-dice-cron-job --image=kodekloud/throw-dice --schedule="30 21 * * *" --dry-run=client -o yaml > throw-dice-cronjob.yaml
```

## history 

spec.successfulJobsHistoryLimit - default 3

spec.failedJobsHistoryLimit  - default 1

## concurrenyPolicy 

The .spec.concurrencyPolicy field is also optional. It specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a job that is created by this CronJob. The spec may specify only one of the following concurrency policies:

    Allow (default): The CronJob allows concurrently running jobs
    Forbid: The CronJob does not allow concurrent runs; if it is time for a new job run and the previous job run hasn't finished yet, the CronJob skips the new job run
    Replace: If it is time for a new job run and the previous job run hasn't finished yet, the CronJob replaces the currently running job run with a new job run

Note that concurrency policy only applies to the jobs created by the same cron job. If there are multiple CronJobs, their respective jobs are always allowed to run concurrently.
