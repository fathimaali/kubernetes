# deployment - rollback 


## Checking Rollout History of a Deployment

Follow the steps given below to check the rollout history:
First, check the revisions of this Deployment:

    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    deployments "nginx-deployment"
    REVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE
    1           kubectl apply --filename=https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
    2           kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
    3           kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161

CHANGE-CAUSE is copied from the Deployment annotation kubernetes.io/change-cause to its revisions upon creation. You can specify theCHANGE-CAUSE message by:
Annotating the Deployment with kubectl annotate deployment/nginx-deployment kubernetes.io/change-cause="image updated to 1.16.1"
Manually editing the manifest of the resource.

To see the details of each revision, run:

    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment --revision=2

The output is similar to this:

    deployments "nginx-deployment" revision 2
      Labels:       app=nginx
              pod-template-hash=1159050644
      Annotations:  kubernetes.io/change-cause=kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
      Containers:
       nginx:
        Image:      nginx:1.16.1
        Port:       80/TCP
         QoS Tier:
            cpu:      BestEffort
            memory:   BestEffort
        Environment Variables:      <none>
      No volumes.

## Rolling Back to a Previous Revision

Follow the steps given below to rollback the Deployment from the current version to the previous version, which is version 2.

Now you've decided to undo the current rollout and rollback to the previous revision:

    kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back

Alternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with --to-revision:

    kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment rolled back

For more details about rollout related commands, read kubectl rollout.

The Deployment is now rolled back to a previous stable revision. As you can see, a DeploymentRollback event for rolling back to revision 2 is generated from Deployment controller.

Check if the rollback was successful and the Deployment is running as expected, run:

    kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           30m

Get the description of the Deployment:

    kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    Name:                   nginx-deployment
    Namespace:              default
    CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 02 Sep 2018 18:17:55 -0500
