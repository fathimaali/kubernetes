# labels 

Labels are pairs of key and value attached to objects like Pods in Kubernetes. They provide identifying attributes for objects without directly impacting the core system's functionality. Labels are useful for organizing and selecting subsets of objects. They can be added or modified anytime and allow efficient queries. Labels are valuable for UIs and CLIs, while annotations are used for non-identifying information.

Labels offer a way to structure system objects according to users' needs without enforcing strict hierarchies. They are key in managing complex entities like service deployments and batch processing pipelines. Examples of labels include "release," "environment," "tier," "partition," and "track," which help categorize objects. Label keys must be unique.

Label syntax involves key/value pairs. Valid label keys consist of an optional prefix and a required name, adhering to character rules. Prefixes are DNS subdomains if used. Prefixes like kubernetes.io/ and k8s.io/ are reserved for core components. Valid label values must follow certain length and character guidelines.

Here's an example Pod manifest with labels:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: label-demo
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80```

In this example, the Pod named "label-demo" has labels "environment: production" and "app: nginx".
