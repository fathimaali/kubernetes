# Pausing and Resuming a rollout of a Deployment

When you update a Deployment, or plan to, you can pause rollouts for that Deployment before you trigger one or more updates. When you're ready to apply those changes, you resume rollouts for the Deployment. This approach allows you to apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.

For example, with a Deployment that was created:

Get the Deployment details:

    kubectl get deploy

The output is similar to this:

    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     3         3         3            3           1m

Get the rollout status:

    kubectl get rs

The output is similar to this:

    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m

Pause by running the following command:

    kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused

then update the image of the Deployment:

    kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated

Notice that no new rollout started:

    kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    deployments "nginx"
    REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
    1   <none>

Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:

    kubectl get rs

The output is similar to this:

    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m

You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:

    kubectl set resources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated

The initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.

Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:

    kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

    deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed

Watch the status of the rollout until it's done.

    kubectl get rs -w

the output is similar to this:

    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   2         2         2         2m
    nginx-3926361531   2         2         0         6s
    nginx-3926361531   2         2         1         18s
    nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
    nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
    nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
    nginx-2142116321   1         1         1         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         1         18s
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         2         19s
    nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
    nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
    nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         20s

Get the status of the latest rollout:

    kubectl get rs

The output is similar to this:

    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
    nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         28s

Note: You cannot rollback a paused Deployment until you resume it.
