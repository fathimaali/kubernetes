## managing objects in k8s

    vim example-pod.yaml
    kubectl create -f example-pod.yaml
    kubectl describe pod example-pod
---
hybrid creation of a pod, where we get --dry-run=client to manifest a yaml file and then we edit and create pod using that yaml file declaratively.


## U

---
    kubectl edit example-pod
---
edit an object that is live already. 
this command opens up the yaml in editor and then auto applies the changes once the edit is complete. 
super handy. 

---
    kubectl replace -f example-pod.yaml
---
replaces live object, eg. pod to the definition in example-pod.yaml


## D

---
    kubectl delete pod example-pod
    # or
    kubectl delete -f example-pod.yaml
---
either of these commands can delete the pod exmaple-pod
