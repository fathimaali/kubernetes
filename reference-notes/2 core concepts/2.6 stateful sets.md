# stateful sets

ordered graceful deployment

when sequence of pod spin up is important
when pod naming should be constant - dns record

yaml same as deployment, just that the type is different 
it also needs a headless service : spec.serviceName

```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata: 
        name: myapp-ss
        labels: 
            app: myapp
    spec: 
        template: 
            metadata: 
                name: my-app-pod
                labels: 
                    app: myapp
            spec: 
                containers: 
                    - name: my-app-container
                      image: nginx
        replicas: 3
        selector: 
            matchLabels:
                app: myapp
        serviceName: mysql-h
```

### scale

is graceful too, one after another 

###  spec.podManagementPolicy 

default value :  spec.podManagementPolicy : OrderedReady
we could override the default gracefulness of order by spec.podManagementPolicy : Parallel 
- this will just make sure the order does not matter, but we have consistent network identifiers now.
