# Pods. 

abstraction over container.

states of a pod 

* pending - one or more containers images not created yet 
* running - one or more containers running 
* suceeded - all containers suceeded, ran 
* failed - container terminated, at least one failed with error
* unknown - for some reason, the state of the pod could not be obtained.

lifecycle : 

* pending - waiting for the pod to get assigned to a noe
* ContainerCreating - fetches the container needed for this pod
* Running - running until the app runs or is terminated

Pod Conditions : 

* PodScheduled
* Initialized
* ContainersReady 
* Ready

commands 

### creating a pod 
```
    > kubectl run example-pod --image=nginx
    > kubectl get pods
```

* get the pod manifest, i.e. yaml, edit and then create the pod
```
    > kubectl run example-pod1 --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > example-pod2.yaml 
    > code exmaple-pod2.yaml
    > kubectl create -f example-pod2.yaml
```

### editing the pod

to edit an existing POD, please note the following:

    If you are given a pod definition file, edit that file and use it to create a new pod.

    If you are not given a pod definition file, you may extract the definition to a file using the below command:

    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod-definition.yaml

    Then edit the file to make the necessary changes, delete and re-create the pod.

    Use the kubectl edit pod <pod-name> command to edit pod properties.

also, we **cannot** edit specifications of an existing pod other than the specs below
    - spec.containers[*].image
    - spec.initContainers[*].image
    - spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
    - spec.tolerations

**when editing deployments however, all pod specs can be changed, and the depl can be edited because underneath it all, after the edit, the pods get deleted and re-created.**

### rendering pod details
```
    > kubectl describe example-pod
    > kubectl describe example-pod | grep Image
    > kubectl describe example-pod -o yaml 
    > kubectl describe example-pod -o wide
    > kubectl describe example-pod -o yaml > example-pod.yaml 
```

### accessing logs of a pod 
``` 
    > kubectl logs example-pod
```

### executing command in a cotainer 
```
    > kubectl exec -it example-pod -- /bin/sh
    # here -i is stdin, -t is stdin tty (terminal)
    
    > kubectl exec exmaple-pod --env
    # gets the env variables, notice we removed the interactive -i and -t 
```

### deleting a pod 
``` 
    > kubectl delete pod example-pod 
    > kubectl delete -f example-pod.yaml
```
either of these work 

### configuring pods
    * environment variables 
        ``` 
            
        ```
