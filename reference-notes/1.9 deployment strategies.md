## canary deployment

route only a small percentage of the traffic to the new version deployment and if tests are good, route all traffic to the new version

the percentage of traffic is governed by the number of pods in each deployment, meaning if old and new deployments have the same number of pods, then the traffic routed would be 50% to each.
less control on the percentage, hence.
