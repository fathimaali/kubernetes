configMap:

```yaml

    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata: 
        name: nginx-configuration
```

service - to expose the ingress controller to the external world 

selector - to link this service to the deployment

```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata: 
        name: nginx-ingress
    spec: 
        type: NodePort

        selector:
            name: nginx-ingress
```
serviceAccount - for the ingress controller to be able to watch the cluster and manage new ingress resources

serviceaccount needs to be created with the correct roles, clusterRoles, RoleBindings.

```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: serviceAccount
    metadata: 
        name: nginx-ingress-serviceaccount

## ingress resource

rules and configurations applied on the ingress controller

routing rules

url based\
domain based

an ingress resource is a k8s primitive - ingress: 

* simple example - ingress routing to an app called dog-app with its service called dog-app-service on port 80, of course not routed to pods directly, but via the app's service.

    ```yaml
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata: 
            name: ingress-dog-app
        spec: 
            backend: 
                service:
                    name: dog-app-service
                    port: 
                        number: 80
    ```

* rule - routing from one domain www.dog-app.com, different paths of app /run, /eat. 

    1 rule 2 paths

    ```yaml
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata: 
            name: ingress-dog-app
        spec: 
            rules: 
                - http: 
                    paths: 
                        - path: /run
                          backend: 
                            service:

                                    number: 80

                                    number: 80

    ``` 

* default rule - 

also : 

Format - kubectl create ingress <ingress-name> --rule="host/path=service:port"

once these are deployed with 

```
    kubectl apply -f
```

we proceed to ensure /etc/hosts is updated to do the lookup properly.
external requests go from browser -> ingress controller -> rule evaluation based on ingress config -> service (webpp-with-an-ingress-service)

done.


## rewrite-target?

Our watch app displays the video streaming webpage at http://<watch-service>:<port>/

Our wear app displays the apparel webpage at http://<wear-service>:<port>/

We must configure Ingress to achieve the below. When user visits the URL on the left, his request should be forwarded internally to the URL on the right. Note that the /watch and /wear URL path are what we configure on the ingress controller so we can forwarded users to the appropriate application in the backend. The applications don't have this URL/Path configured on them:

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch --> http://<watch-service>:<port>/

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear --> http://<wear-service>:<port>/


Without the rewrite-target option, this is what would happen:

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch --> http://<watch-service>:<port>/watch

http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear --> http://<wear-service>:<port>/wear


Notice watch and wear at the end of the target URLs. The target applications are not configured with /watch or /wear paths. They are different applications built specifically for their purpose, so they don't expect /watch or /wear in the URLs. And as such the requests would fail and throw a 404 not found error.


To fix that we want to "ReWrite" the URL when the request is passed on to the watch or wear applications. We don't want to pass in the same path that user typed in. So we specify the rewrite-target option. This rewrites the URL by replacing whatever is under rules->http->paths->path which happens to be /pay in this case with the value in rewrite-target. This works just like a search and replace function.

For example: replace(path, rewrite-target)
In our case: replace("/path","/")


    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: test-ingress
      namespace: critical-space
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    spec:
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /pay
            backend:
              serviceName: pay-service
              servicePort: 8282


In another example given here, this could also be:

replace("/something(/|$)(.*)", "/$2")

    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
      name: rewrite
      namespace: default
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: rewrite.bar.com
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: http-svc
              servicePort: 80
            path: /something(/|$)(.*)
