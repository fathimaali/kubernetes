## Services

pods inside a cluster talk to each other using their IPs, and since pods are ephemeral and IPs associated with them can change with the lifecycle of a pod, we use Services to get static IP. the lifecycle of a service is isolated from the lifecycle of a pod.


Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379
    kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors)

Or

    kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml 
(This will not use the pods' labels as selectors; instead it will assume selectors as app=redis. You cannot pass in selectors as an option. So it does not work well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)

Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:
    kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --name nginx-service --type=NodePort --dry-run=client -o yaml
(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port in manually before creating the service with the pod.)

Or

    kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will not use the pods' labels as selectors)
Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the `kubectl expose` command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the service.



there are four types of services 

* **NodePort** 
    - opens up communication, the nodePort range can only be from 30000-32767

    - if there are more than one endpoint auto selected because of the labels selector, this randomly distributes load across the endpoints. kind of like a built in loadbalancer
    - works 
        - single pod - single node
        ![Alt text](/reference-notes/7%20services%20and%20networking/image%20attachments%20-%20ignore/nodeport2.png)
        - multiple pod - single node
        ![Alt text](/reference-notes/7%20services%20and%20networking/image%20attachments%20-%20ignore/nodeport3.png)
        - multiple pod - multiple nodes
        ![Alt text](/reference-notes/7%20services%20and%20networking/image%20attachments%20-%20ignore/nodeport4.png)


    ```yaml - nodeport
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata: 
            name: sample-service
        spec: 
            type: nodePort
            ports: 
                - targetPort: 80
                  port: 80
                  nodePort: 30000
            selector: 
                app: myapp
    ```
    ```
        kubectl create -f sample-service.yaml
        kubcetl get services
    ```

* **clusterIP** - 

    - ClusterIP can mean 2 things: a type of service which is only accessible within a Kubernetes cluster, or the internal ("virtual") IP of components within a Kubernetes cluster 
    
    ```yaml - clusterip
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata: 
            name: backend
        spec:  
            type: ClusterIP
            ports: 
            - targetPort: 80
              port: 80
            selector: 
              app: myapp
    ```


* **Headless Service** - headless service that lets you identify pods to talk to
* **LoadBalancer** - 

how do we know which service is tied to which pod? i.e. what pods are its endpoints?

spec.selector: in service manifest


Service

Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml
