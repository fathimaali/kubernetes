# headless service

does not load balance and gives a 

is created like a regular service, but it does not an IP : the differentiating factor is **clusterIP: None**

and also each pod managed by it gets a dns record 

podname.headless-servicename.namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
    name: mysql-h
spec: 
   clusterIP : None
   ports:
   - port: 3306
   selector: 
    app: mysql
```

when we want a pod to have a static dns A record and be fronted by the headless service we define it like below

spec.subdomain: name of the headless service
hostname: pod's name

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
    name: myapp-pod
    labels: 
        app: mysql
spec: 
    containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql
    subdomain: mysql-h
    hostname: mysql-pod
```

note: notice how in a deployment if the above pod definition is used, all the pod replicas will now have the same A record, and would be not unique?

enter: StatefulSet

in a StatefulSet definition we don't need to specify the subdomain or hostname, just simply add the serviceName : name of headless Service for it to know and create the dns A records correctly automatically.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata: 
    name: mysql-ss
    labels: 
        app: mysql
spec:
    serviceName: mysql-h
    replicas: 3
    matchLabels: 
        app: mysql
    template: 
        metadata: 
            name: myapp-pod
            labels: 
                app: mysql
        spec: 
            containers:
            - name: mysql
              image: mysql
```
