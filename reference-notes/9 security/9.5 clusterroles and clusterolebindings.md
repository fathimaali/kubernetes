# clusterroles and clusterrolebindings

for resources that are NOT namespace bound, rather they are bound to the scope of the cluster

    kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true # these resources are namespace bound
    kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false # these are cluster bound

clusterroles and clusterrolebindings are for authorizing users to cluster bound (non namespaced) resources

### ALSO - if we create a clusterrole and a clusterrolebinding to a NAMESPACED resource, then the user would have access to the NAMESPACED resource across all the namespaces

## clusterrole

same format as role

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: monitoring-endpoints
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

## clusterrolebinding

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: monitoring-endpoints-binding
subjects:
 - kind: User
   name: cluster-admin
   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
   kind: ClusterRole
   name: cluster-administrator
   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
