# roles and rolebindings


## RBAC

roles and rolebindings are bound to a namespace

    kubectl get roles
    kubectl get rolebinding
    kubcetl describe role developer
    kubcetl describe rolebinding dev-user-binding

developer-role.yaml - create the role

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

on the role yaml

rules().resourceNames: - with a list of resource names specifically can restrict the user to only those resources and not all the resources under the namespace for example

RoleBinding - bind the rule to the user

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "dave" to read secrets in the "development" namespace.
# You need to already have a ClusterRole named "secret-reader".
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-secrets
  #
  # The namespace of the RoleBinding determines where the permissions are granted.
  # This only grants permissions within the "development" namespace.
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dave # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

    kubectl auth can-i create deployments
    kubectl auth can-i delete nodes

    for another user
