1. Node
     access within the cluster\
     node authorizer\
     kubelet - part of the system:nodes group and has username system:node:*\
     node authorizer authorizes this call from the kubelet to the kubeapi based on the above\
2. ABAC
    external access to the api\
    attribute based access control\
    create a policy file in a json format\
    this json file contains the list of users and the authority they have\
    difficult to maintain or add new users - would need manual addition of entry and then restart kubeapi\
3. RBAC
    role based access control\
    create a role and associate the user to that role\
    easy maintanence
4. Webhook
    outsource auth mechanism
    kubeapi can call 3rd party agent for authorization
