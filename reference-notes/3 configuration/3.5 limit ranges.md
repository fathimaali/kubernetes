# LimitRange.

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/>

bound to a namespace

This object allows us to provide defaults for the CPU or memory, or both. If a LimitRange object exists in a namespace, then any container created without the resource requests or limits configured in LimitRange will inherit these values from the limit range.

There are two situations where LimitRange will affect the resource limits or requests when a pod is created:

* Containers that have no resource limits or requests will inherit the resource limit and requests from the LimitRange object
* Containers that have no resource limits but do have requests specified will inherit the resource limit from the LimitRange object

If a container already has limits and requests defined, then LimitRange will have no effect. Because containers that specify only limits default the request field to the same value, they will not inherit the request value from LimitRange.

### creating a limitrange

```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: LimitRange
    metadata:
        name: cpu-resource-constraint
    spec:
        limits:
          - default: # this section defines default limits
                cpu: 500m
            defaultRequest: # this section defines default  requests
                cpu: 500m
            max: # max and min define the limit range
                cpu: "1"
            min:
                cpu: 100m
            type: Container
```

creating a limitrange, does not affect the existing pods, it would only apply to pods that are created after the limitrange was created. 

### creating a request but not a limit

assuming we create a pod manifest specifying a request but not a limit 

the limit is inherited from the default value from the limitrange

### creating a limit but not a request

assuming we create a pod manifest specifying a limit but not a request

the request is created to match the limit value. notice that the default value was not set here

### creating a default value

if a pod manifest does not specify a limit or a request, the default values from the limitRange are inherited.
