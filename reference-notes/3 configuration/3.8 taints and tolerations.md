# taints and tolerations

**taints**- are set on nodes \
**tolerations** - are set on pods to know what *taint* it can tolerate \
**taints and tolerations**- dont guarantee that a pod will be placed on a SPECIFIC node, only (read node affinity). it's more of a mechanism to tell nodes what pods they can accept and which ones they cannot.

also notice how kube-scheduler does not place any pods on the master node, that's because the taint on the master node, is not tolerated by ANY pod.

### taint

---
    > k taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
---
**key-value** is the value of the taint we want to apply \

**taint-effect** indicates what happens to the pod if they DONT tolerate the taint
- NoSchedule - the pods WILL not be scheduled on the node
- PreferNoSchedule - the system TRIES to avoid scheduling the pod on that node, and that is NOT guaranteed.
- NoExecute - new pods WILL not be scheduled on the node, and the exisiting pods will be evicted from the node if they don't tolerate


---
    k taint node node1 app=green:NoSchedule
    k describe node node1 | grep Taint
---

### tolerations

---
    # pod.yaml
    ...
    kind: Pod
    spec: 
        tolerations:
            - key: "app"
              operator: "Equal"
              value: "green"
              effect: "NoSchedule"
---

when add tolerations to the pod spec now, they are either not created anymore on the node that they dont tolerate, or evicted from the node they they dont tolerate based on the *taint-effect*
