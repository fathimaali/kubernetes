# node affinity

advanced capabilites for making sure a pod is placed on a particular node
solves problems faced with node selectors.

defined in pod spec.affinity.nodeAffinity

```
    # pod.yaml

    kind: Pod
    spec: 
        affinity: 
            nodeAffinity:
                requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
                    nodeSelectorTerms: 
                        - matchExpressions 
                            - key: size
                              operator: In
                              values: 
                                - large
                                - medium
```

nodeSelectorTerms is a list \
matchExpressions is a list of keys \
operator : In, NotIn,Exists \
values : is a list \

duringScheduling : means a pod does not exist yet, and is being scheduled/created for the first time
duringExecution : means an existing pod gets affected by changes in the environment, eg. change in label of node

### node affinity types: 

* available for use : 
- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 
   - scheduling - when the pod is being created for the first time, it NEEDS to have a node with matching labels, else it will not be scheduled. if we forgot to label the node, the pod is not scheduled.
    - execution - when a pod has been running and a change in the environment does not make the pod evict out of the node.
- preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 
    - scheduling - when the pod is being created for the first time, it tries to find a node with matching labels, if none found, it is scheuled on any available node.
    - execution - when a pod has been running and a change in the environment does not make the pod evict out of the node.

* planned for future K8s release : 
- requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
