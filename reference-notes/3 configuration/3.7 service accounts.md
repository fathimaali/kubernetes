# Service Accounts

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/>

helps the pod authenticate itself when calling kube-api

bound to a namespace
every namespace has a default serviceaccount

if its not specified in the pod yaml manifest, default serviceaccount is used. the default serviceaccounts has the same permissions as an unauthorized user. 

### creating a serviceaccount

    > k create serviceaccount eg-service-account
        serviceaccount/eg-service-account created
    > k get serviceaccounts
        NAME                 SECRETS   AGE
        default              0         4d1h
        eg-service-account   0         38s

    > k get serviceaccount default -o yaml > default-service-account.yaml

### creating a pod manifest without mentioning the serviceaccount

    > k run eg-pod --image=nginx
    > k get pod eg-pod -o yaml > eg-pod.yaml
        spec:
            serviceAccount: default

### creating a pod with a defined service account

**cannot** edit the service account of an existing pod, must delete and recreate the pod
**can** edit the serviceaccount of an exisiting deployment however. the deployment will take care of deletion and recreation

    > code eg-pod.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
            name: eg-pod
            namespace: default
        spec:
            serviceAccount: eg-service-account
        ...

    > k create -f eg-pod.yaml
        pod/eg-pod created
    > k describe pod eg-pod

        Service Account:  eg-service-account
        Mounts:
            /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-mw5jc (ro)

                    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
                      name: kube-api-access-mw5jc
                      readOnly: true

            volumes:
                - name: kube-api-access-mw5jc
                  projected:
                    defaultMode: 420
                    sources:
                     - serviceAccountToken:
                            expirationSeconds: 3607
                            path: token
             ...   
### pre 1.22 Kubernetes version :
    
the service account has a token with it, that is modeled after a secret. 
    > k get secret {secret_name} -o yaml

    > k describe serviceaccount eg-service-account
        this will display the token of this serviceaccount
    > k describe secret eg-service-account-token
        this will show the value of the token, that has been stored as secret

    > k create -f eg-pod.yaml
        pod/eg-pod created
    > k describe pod eg-pod
        the token can be found here
        the secret(token) is mounted as volume with the pod at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceacount
    > k describe secret eg-pod-token
        can display value
        
### serviceaccount's token mount

by default all secrets live in the etcd 

when a pod in a namespace, associates itself with a serviceaccount, a copy of the serviceaccount is mounted as volume at the pod. when pod dies and a new one is spun up, the serviceaccount is fetched again and mounted again.

the secret object, created for the token that the service account uses is mounted to the pod as volume 
as seen in the examples above
at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceacount

this can be disabled by using 

    spec.automountServiceAccountToken: false
