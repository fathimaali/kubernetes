# node selectors

pre determine a pod to only be created on a particular node.

* label the node 
* use that label on spec.nodeSelector in pod definition

this has drawbacks by design because we cannot apply logical operations like AND or OR on the multiple conditions of node labels.
this problem is solved by node affinity.

## label the node

```
    kubectl label node node-name <label-key>=<label-value>
    kubectl label node node1 size=large
```

## pod spec nodeSelector

```
    # pod.yaml
    kind: Pod
    spec:
        nodeSelector:
            size: large
```
