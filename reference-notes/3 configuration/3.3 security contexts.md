# security contexts

security contexts are not kubernetes primitives.
it's more of a set of attributes under the directive *securityContext* within the pod spec.

additional secuirty configuration for privilige and access control for a pod or a container. 

securityContext - container level security written in the pod spec.
podSecurityContext - pod level security, applies to all containers in the pod

**note**: 

* pod level *securitycontext* is **overriden** by the container level *securitycontext* - i.e. a fine grained *securitycontext* takes precedence. in the example, the container web uses the container level *securityContext* and runs as user 1002, while container ubuntu on the other hand, since it has no *securityContext* of its own, it uses the pod level *securityContext* and runs as user 1001

```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: multi-pod
    spec:
    securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1001
    containers:
    -  image: ubuntu
        name: web
        command: ["sleep", "5000"]
        securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1002

    -  image: ubuntu
        name: sidecar
        command: ["sleep", "5000"]
```

* *runAsNonRoot*: makes sure the container cannot run as root
* *runAsUser*: simply runs as the user specified here, overrides the docker file user value
* *capabilites* - edits linux capabilites for the user, can *add, drop* etc
    **cannot** be applied to Pod's *securityContext* only to a container's
* *fsGroup* -
