# persistent volumes

A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

```yaml
apiVersion: 
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata: 
    name: pv-vol1
spec:
    accessModes: 
        - ReadWriteOnce
    capacity: 
        storage: 1Gi
    hostPath: 
        path: /tmp/data
```

* **spec.accessModes** 
    - ReadOnlyMany - the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
    - ReadWriteOnce - the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. ReadWriteOnce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.
    - ReadWriteMany - the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
    - ReadWriteOncePod - the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. Use ReadWriteOncePod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that PVC or write to it. This is only supported for CSI volumes and Kubernetes version 1.22+.

a persistent volume would be bound to a persistent volume claim in a one to one relationship

if the pvc is deleted, the pv can 
    - remain by using *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete* - not available for another pvc to claim 
    - remain but data is scrubbed out before another pvc is able to claim *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy - Recycle*
    - *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy - Retain*
