# storage in stateful sets

![Alt text](/reference-notes/8%20state%20persistence/images%20-%20ignore/volumeclaimtemplate.png)

we know that a storage class (sc) will dynamically provision the pv when the pod with a pvc is created

what about deployment or statefulsets?

in statefulsets, imagine the pvc is defined on the pod spec, all the pod replicas created will now be pointed to the same pvc (which is mount to the pv auto provisioned by the sc)

ofc if we want this, we can retain it, but not all provisioners supports this operation. ReadWriteMany

if we dont want the pods to share storage and want isolated storage from each other?

enter: volumeClaimTemplate

it's like a pvc but templatized into the stateful set spec.volumeClaimTemplate

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3 # by default is 1
  minReadySeconds: 10 # by default is 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # has to match .spec.selector.matchLabels
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: registry.k8s.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "my-storage-class"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

so now, when a pod is spun up it creates a pvc which is associated to an sc which knows to create a pv and also creates a storage on the cloud eg. gce or ebs, and associates the volume with the pv which is then bound to the pvc

if a pod is restarted / recreated - the statefulset does not auto delete the pvc that the pod used to have, so when it gets recreated in the same node or different node, it knows to associate the pod with the same pvc it used to have
