# volumes

a volume is used to hold data that is processed or output by a pod, even after the pod is dead. 

do note that the path for volume, eg. /custom is *static provisioning* meaning the location needs to exist before it can be used by this pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
    name: pod
spec: 
    containers: 
        - image: nginx
          name: nginx
          command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]
          args: ["shuf -i 0-100 -n l >> /mypath/number.out"]
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /mypath
            name: data-volume
    volumes:
        - name: data-volume
          hostPath: 
            path: /custom
            type: directory
```

**spec.container.volumeMounts** - can tell us which volume needs to be mounted where on the pod
**spec.volume** - tells us what the volume that lives on even after a pod is dead
**volumes.hostPath** - can refer to the path on the node or on the entire cluster where /custom is present
**volumes.awsElasticBlockStore** - for example can be used for storage volume
