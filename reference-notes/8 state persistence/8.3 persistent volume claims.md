# persistent volume claims

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or ReadWriteMany, see AccessModes).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata: 
    name: myPVC
spec:   
    accessModes: 
        - ReadWriteOnce
    resources: 
        requests:
            storage: 500Mi
```

on the pod and hence by extension on replicaSet, deployment can look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
    name: mypod
spec: 
    containers: 
        - image: nginx
          name: nginx-c
          volumeMounts: 
            - mountPath: /mypath
              name: mypvc
    volumes:
        - name: mypvc
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: myclaim
```
