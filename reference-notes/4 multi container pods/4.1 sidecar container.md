# sidecar container

a sidecar pattern container that runs on the same pod as the main application container

helper for the main webapp container

usecase: logging 

### creating a pod with a main webapp and a sidecar logger app that would share the same volume mount

```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: two-containers
    spec:

      restartPolicy: Never

      volumes:
      - name: shared-data
        emptyDir: {}

      containers:

      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html

      - name: debian-container
        image: debian
        volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-data
          mountPath: /pod-data
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "echo Hello from the debian container > /pod-data/index.html"]
```

The primary reason that Pods can have multiple containers is to support helper applications that assist a primary application. Typical examples of helper applications are data pullers, data pushers, and proxies. Helper and primary applications often need to communicate with each other. Typically this is done through a shared filesystem, as shown in this exercise, or through the loopback network interface, localhost. 

The Volume in this exercise provides a way for Containers to communicate during the life of the Pod.**If the Pod is deleted and recreated, any data stored in the shared Volume is lost.**
