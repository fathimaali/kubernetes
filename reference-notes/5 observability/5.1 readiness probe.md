# readiness probe

readiness probe is to test whether an app inside a container is ready to accept traffic

sometimes the container is ready
but the app takes a bit longer to be ready 

so with readiness probe, we mitigate the time of unresponsiveness from the app

Readiness probes determine whether a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. If a container fails its readiness probe, it is removed from Service load balancers, ensuring that only healthy containers receive traffic.

types
* HTTP test - /api/ready 
* TCP test - example DB 
* custom command test

how do we write this on to the pod definition?

* HTTP test 

 --- 
    pod.yaml 
    ...
    spec: 
        containers: 
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx 
        ...
          readinessProbe: 
              httpGet:
              path: /api/ready
              port: 8080

---

* TCP test

---
    pod.yaml
    ...
    spec: 
        containers:
            - name: nginx
              image: nginx
              readinessProbe: 
                tcpSocket: 
                port: 3306
---

* Custom Exec Command 

---
    pod.yaml
    ...
    spec: 
    containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx
            readinessProbe: 
                exec: 
                    command: 
                        - cat
                        - /app/is_ready
    ...

### some attributes to add to readiness probe


* *initialDelaySeconds* - how long to wait before we check readiness
* *periodSeconds*: how long to wait before re-checking
* *failureThreshold* - how many times to check before complaining
* *timeoutSeconds*: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.
* *successThreshold*: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup Probes. Minimum value is 1.
* *terminationGracePeriodSeconds*: configure a grace period for the kubelet to wait between triggering a shut down of the failed container, and then forcing the container runtime to stop that container
