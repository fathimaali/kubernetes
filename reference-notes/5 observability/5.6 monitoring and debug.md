## monitoring 

    metrics monitoring 
        CPU utilization

    services : 
        metrics server (previousy heapster)
        prometheus
        elastic search 
        datadog
        dynatrace

metrics server : 

in-memory monitoring solution
no historical metrics, hence
aggregates metrics from nodes and pods in a cluster


*kubelet* running on a worker node, has a component called *cAdvisor* that collects the performance metrics of the containers in the pod and sends it over to the metrics server in the *kubeapi*


how to install a metric server in the cluster?

https://signoz.io/blog/kubernetes-metrics-server/


```
    git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server

    kubectl create -f deply/1.8+/
```

once installed and metrics server has been able to collect some metrics it can be viewed with 

for node

```
    kubectl top node
```

for pods

```
    kubectl top pod
```
